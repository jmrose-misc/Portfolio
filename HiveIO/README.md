| Tools Used    | Confluence, CSS to make PDF imports pretty |

HiveIO primarily relied on Confluence for internal documentation, intended for 
support teams, and external documentation, intended for customers. To view any 
public-facing documentation that I wrote, please view the following links.:

[Hive Fabric 6.12 Documentation](https://hiveio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HIO612/overview)

[Hive Fabric 7.0 Documentation](https://hiveio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HF70/overview)

[Hive Fabric 7.1 Documentation](https://hiveio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HF71/overview)

[Hive Fabric 7.2 Documentation](https://hiveio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HF72/overview)

(One may notice how much I also improved my own documenting processes for HiveIO too!)

Confluence Administrators also had the means to export full PDF files of 
documents. Editors with HTML and CSS knowledge could edit the look and feel of 
these PDFs before generating the export. This repo contains an example of what 
a PDF export of a Confluence Wiki may look like.
